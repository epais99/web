					<p class="descriptionText">At Primerica we help our clients organize their budgetary expenses and constraints, identify what's important, and often cut down the cost of some of their various expenses. We also provide counsel on debt consolidation and retirement planning. Lastly, we can help in the establishment of family funds and the acquisition of life insurance and other forms of insurance.  </p>

					<p class="greetingText">Why Primerica?</p>
					<p class="descriptionText">Primerica does business through a network of independent contractors like myself. As such, while experiences may vary our services are more tailored to the client and can range from acquiring a brand new plan to lowering the cost of your current plan.
